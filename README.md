# Framework: Next.js

Utilizes server-side rendering (SSR) for improved performance and SEO.
Supports dynamic routing for easy navigation between pages.
#Styling: Tailwind CSS

Provides a modern, responsive design with utility-first classes.
Ensures the application adapts to various screen sizes.

# UI Components:

Streamlines the creation of interactive elements like buttons and forms.
Enhances user experience and usability.

# Structure:

Organized folder structure with clear separation of pages (for routing) and components (for reusable UI elements).
Incorporates environment variables for managing sensitive information.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
